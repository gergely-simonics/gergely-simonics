👋🏼 Hi, and Welcome in my git repo. I’m Gergely Simonics, a former front end dev in Angular + Dart, currently a 🚕 driver.
My previous workplace where I worked mainly as a frontend dev(1,5yrs), was so toxic that I had to lift my ass up from the 💻, and do something else.
I was driving around in the past 6 months, now I am starting to get my shit together and jump back in the business.

At the moment I am reworking one of my [older projects](http://gabannabutterfly.eu) :
                                              <br/>&emsp;db:       posgreSql -> cassandra (nosql)
                                              <br/>&emsp;backend:  java 11 -> php 8+
                                              <br/>&emsp;frontend: reactJS -> Angular + TypeScript
                                              

Currently my main interest is backend, if possible php (sweet sweet 8+ :D).
